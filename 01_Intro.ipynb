      "Python is easy to pick up if you have done any kind of programming before, and even if you haven't. It is easy to express ideas at a high level without worrying about boilerplate and fiddly bits of other languages. Because the course is designed to intorduce different ways of programming, these will be taught in a simple manner that doesn't require a lot of prior experience. You can get a good crash course at [http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) if you feel you need to get up-to-speed at any point.
